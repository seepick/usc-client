# Todo

* first release & integrate; then refactor/redesign
* get fixtures dependency working
* delayed, cached impl (to read creds at runtime, from UI for example)
* enhance system test app; print all venues; for easier debugging
* move tests in proper package
* resolve all todos
* system tests (enable-able); only run locally (add bin/validate.sh file)
